# accord

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of accord is to provide an interface to the Discord API.

## Installation

You can install the released version of accord from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("accord")
```

## Usage

## Other Works

There are a few implementations of Discord API functions at the moment:

-   [discordr](https://github.com/jljsio/discordr/) by Jordan Love seems
    to provide the ability to post messages via webhook. Only on GitHub.
-   [Pirate](https://github.com/TheOnlyArtz/Pirate) by Amit Katz wraps
    more of the API and data models but is less maintained, uses R6, and
    doesn’t seem to have much documentation (?)
